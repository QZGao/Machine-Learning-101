    "NumPy is the foundational library for numerical computing in Python and forms the backbone of the entire ML ecosystem. This notebook focuses on hands-on examples with practical ML context, aimed at beginners who want to understand how NumPy powers machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why NumPy for ML?** Every ML library (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) uses NumPy arrays as their core data structure. Understanding NumPy is essential for:\n",
    "- Representing datasets as multi-dimensional arrays\n",
    "- Implementing ML algorithms efficiently\n",
